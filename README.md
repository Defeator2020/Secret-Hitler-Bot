# Secret Hitler Bot
A bot to play the game Secret Hitler in Discord.

Relies on the discord.py library:
- Webpage: https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html
- GitHub: https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py

As well as the 'os' and 'random' libraries.

A seriously rough, yet functional, work in progress.
Requires that your server has the following roles:
- "Secret Hitler"
- "Liberal"
- "Fascist"

IMPORTANT: Remember to change the ".env" file to reflect your own bot token and server id.
